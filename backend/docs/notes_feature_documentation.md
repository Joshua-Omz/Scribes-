## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Model (`app/models/notes.py`)

The `Note` model represents the database structure for storing notes:

```python
class Note(Base):
    __tablename__ = "notes"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)

    title = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
    content = Column(Text, nullable=False)

    preacher = Column(String(100), nullable=True)  # optional field
    tags = Column(String(255), nullable=True)      # comma-separated tags
    scripture_refs = Column(String(255), nullable=True)  # e.g. "John 3:16, Matt 5:9"

    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
    updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())

    # Relationship (optional but good for queries later)
    user = relationship("User", back_populates="notes")
```

**Key Features:**
- User-specific notes with foreign key relationship
- Automatic timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Optional fields for preacher, tags, and scripture references
- Cascade delete when user is deleted
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Data Schemas (`app/schemas/notes.py`)

The Pydantic schemas define the API request/response structures with comprehensive validation:

#### `NoteBase`
- Common fields shared across all note schemas
- Validation for required fields (title, content)
- Tag sanitization and length validation
- Custom validators for input cleaning

#### `NoteCreate`
- Used for creating new notes
- Inherits all validation from NoteBase
- Ensures all required fields are provided

#### `NoteUpdate`
- Used for updating existing notes
- All fields are optional for partial updates
- Maintains validation rules for provided fields

#### `NoteResponse`
- API response format with all necessary fields
- Includes database-generated fields (id, timestamps)
- ORM mode enabled for automatic SQLAlchemy model conversion
- Proper JSON encoding for datetime fields

#### `NoteListResponse`
- Paginated list response with metadata
- Includes total count, pagination parameters
- Structured for efficient API responses

#### `NoteSearchRequest`
- Search query validation with minimum length requirements
- Pagination parameters with reasonable limits
- Input sanitization for search queries

### 3. Repository Layer (`app/db/repositories/note_repository.py`)

The repository layer handles all database operations with security and performance considerations:

#### Core Functions:
- `create_note()` - Create new notes with proper field mapping and validation
- `get_note_by_user()` - Retrieve specific note with ownership validation
- `get_notes_by_user_paginated()` - Get user's notes with pagination support
- `update_note()` - Update notes with security validation and mass assignment protection
- `delete_note()` - Delete notes with proper cleanup
- `search_notes_by_user()` - Full-text search across title, content, tags, and scripture references

#### Security Features:
- User ownership validation for all operations
- Mass assignment protection through explicit field whitelisting
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input sanitization and validation

#### Additional Functions:
- `get_notes_count_by_user()` - Get total note count for user statistics
- `get_recent_notes_by_user()` - Get most recently updated notes for dashboard display

### 4. Service Layer (`app/services/note_service.py`)

The service layer provides business logic, validation, and comprehensive error handling:

#### Core Functions:
- `create_note_service()` - Note creation with input validation and sanitization
- `get_note_service()` - Note retrieval with access control and error handling
- `get_notes_service()` - Paginated note listing with performance optimization
- `update_note_service()` - Note updates with validation and security checks
- `delete_note_service()` - Note deletion with ownership verification
- `search_notes_service()` - Note search with query validation and rate limiting

#### Security & Validation Features:
